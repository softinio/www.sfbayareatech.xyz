SF Scala is a group for functional programmers who use Scala to dominate the world. We build APIs, Big Data flows, and startups powered by Scala. We do more with less people and less resoucres due to Scala's incredible power. We meet to discuss best practices and how the technology is being used successfully by organizations.

SF Scala covers San Francisco, and events are coordinated with , which covers the peninsula and south bay.

Recordings are posted on our YouTube channel: [functional.tv](http://functional.tv)
