We are a group of startup engineers, research scientists, computational linguists, mathematicians, philosophers, and others interested in understanding the meaning of text, reasoning, and human intent through technology. We want to apply our understanding to building new businesses and improving overall human experience in the modern connected world.

This is a technical AI meetup: we build systems with Machine Learning on top of Data Pipelines, and concern ourselves with the stuff we can try in open source, learn, improve, and model human behavior in industry for practical results.
