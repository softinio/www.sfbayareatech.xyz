This is a developer-centric meetup focused on Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Apache Kafka, Apache Mesos, related Typesafe and Twitter OSS stacks, and broader distributed Data Science and Machine Learning. We're open to all OSS developers, vendors, consultants, and startups both using the tools and building or supporting them, attending, presenting, and organizing.

How it may be complementary to the original Spark Users, now Bay Area Spark Meetup: Spark in its end-to-end ecosystem -- Mesos, Akka, Kafka, Cassandra, etc., with focus on what works for the final goals of the whole pipeline. We will teach you how to use Scala for Spark to make you more effective, and consider devops options so you can get to production faster. We'll invite projects relevant to or inspired by Apache Spark, such as Apache Storm, Apache Flink, and others, and will be focused on putting together useful OSS as a system.

Recordings are posted on our YouTube channel: [functional.tv](http://functional.tv)
