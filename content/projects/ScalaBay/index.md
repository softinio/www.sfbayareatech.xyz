Scala Bay is a group for functional programmers who use Scala to dominate the world. We build APIs, Big Data flows, and startups powered by Scala. We do more with less people and less resoucres due to Scala's incredible power. We meet to discuss best practices and how the technology is being used successfully by organizations.

Scala Bay covers Silicon Valley and South Bay.

Recordings are posted on our YouTube channel: [functional.tv](http://functional.tv)
