Our community stands to maintain a platform that enables individuals to contribute, connect and collaborate ideas whilst supporting each other in the process of attaining their ambitions.

This platform was created to be an environment in which everyone can engage in a positive way and in a friendly atmosphere. We encourage being civil, cordial and respectful of everyone. We encourage empathy, and also being respectful of viewpoints that differ from your own.

We will not tolerate harassment of any type, as we are committed to maintaining a platform that is safe for everyone, regardless of personal characteristics such as gender, physical appearance, gender identity, disability, sexual orientation, race or religion. Our expectations are that our members act in good faith and do not deliberately antagonize others. Any and all offenders of this code of conduct may be removed from our space at the consideration of our administrators.
