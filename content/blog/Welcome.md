Hi Everyone, 

I am [Salar Rahmanian](https://www.softinio.com), a software engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. As a software engineer I am very passionate about learning and networking with like minded techies. As such I am a very proactive meetup organizer in the Bay Area. 

I have created this community to give everyone in tech in the bay area a community to keep in touch with each other via discord and slack, learn from each other by means of arranging talks, meetups and book clubs and help each other succeed. 

#### Contribute ####

This is your community and we can make it a great if all contribute to it. I need your help with a few things: 

- Please join our slack and/or discord communities and take part in regular conversation. Be it sharing a joke, argueing over vim being better than emacs (it is!) or just how your day is going. Even ask a technical question :-) 
- Tell your network about this community and have them join. Its good to keep in touch with colleagues and friends on something separate than the work slack :-) 
- Attend our meetups and events and consider helping as a speaker
- Provide feedback to make everything better

#### Meetups ####

If you look at our home page you will see details of the meetup groups I help organize and run. Get in touch with me if you would like to do a talk at any of my meetups.

If you have never done a talk before, don't be shy, you are amongst friends who will help you get good at it. Our events are not like a formal conference, it is very informal and there to facilitate knowledge share. 

In particular I am very interested in getting more diversity into my events both as speakers and attendees. So if you are from an underrepresented group in tech, I am happy to provide mentorship and help with preparing you for your talk, so don't hesitate to get in touch. And if its something that I can't help with I am sure I can find the help needed to turn your idea into a great talk. 

If you are a meetup organizer and would like to be part of our community and be listed on our site and have your own channel on our discord/slack please get in touch with me. As long as we share the same principals, goals and values for what we want for this community which I would like to discuss with you and agree on then it would be wonderful to have you part of this community and we can all help each other. 

#### Why? ####

One point to make clear is why I am putting a lot of my time in building this community and running meetups. I enjoy it! I learn and get to meet like minded people. The best part of it for me though is helping each other. 

I wanted to point this out so that it is noticed that I am volunteering my time to do this and I am not some big corporation.

#### Feedback ####

If you have any feedback or you simply want to talk to me get in touch via Discord/Slack. Or  you can create an issue with your [feedback here](https://github.com/softinio/www.sfbayareatechies.com/issues).
